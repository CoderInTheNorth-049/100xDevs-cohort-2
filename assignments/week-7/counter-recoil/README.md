# Recoil State Management Example

This project demonstrates the use of Recoil, a state management library for React. It showcases how to manage state with atoms and selectors, and how to optimize component re-renders using Recoil hooks.

## Components

1. **App**: The root component that initializes the Recoil state.
2. **Count**: A container component that includes `CountRenderer`, `Buttons`, and `EvenStatus`.
3. **CountRenderer**: Displays the current value of the count state.
4. **Buttons**: Contains buttons to increment and decrement the count state.
5. **EvenStatus**: Displays a message if the current count is even.
